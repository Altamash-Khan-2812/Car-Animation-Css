# Car Animation CSS and JavaScript

This project demonstrates a simple car animation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Preview

You can see the animation live [HERE](https://car-animation-ayan.netlify.app/).

## How It Works

The HTML structure consists of a container with elements representing the sky, trees, track, and a car. The car itself is composed of two wheels and their corresponding images.

The CSS files (`style.css` and `responsive.css`) handle the styling and layout of the elements, while the JavaScript file (`script.js`) is responsible for animating the car.

## Files

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the animation.
- `style.css`: Defines the styles for the animation.
- `responsive.css`: Contains styles for responsive design.
- `script.js`: Manages the animation of the car.

## Usage

You can simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser to see the animation in action.
