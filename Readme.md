# Car Animation HTML and CSS

This project demonstrates a simple car animation using HTML and CSS.

## Preview

You can see the animation live <a href="https://car-animation-altamash.netlify.app/" target="_blank">HERE</a>.

## How It Works

The HTML structure consists of a container with elements representing the sky, trees, track, and a car. The car itself is composed of two wheels and their corresponding images.

The CSS files (`style.css` and `responsive.css`) handle the styling and layout and animation of the elements.

## Files

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the animation.
- `style.css`: Defines the styles for the animation.
- `responsive.css`: Contains styles for responsive design.

## Usage

You can simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser to see the animation in action.
